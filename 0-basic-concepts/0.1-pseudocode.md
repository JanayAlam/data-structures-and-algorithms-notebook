# Pseudocode

Pseudocode is an English-like representation of the algorithm logic. There are several tools for defining algorithms or codes. One of the most common tools for defining algorithms is pseudocode, which is part English, part structured code. The English part provides syntax that describes what must be done without showing unnecessary details.

The syntax of a programming language is different from other programming languages but the concept of a data structure or algorithm is the same for all. Their implementation syntax varied based on programming language only. For example, the logic to determine the sum of elements of an array is the same for every programming language. But implementation of this logic varied on the programming language. Pseudocode is used to describe logic. That logic can be implemented in different languages. That's why we use pseudocode to determine algorithms first.

An example of pseudocode is, where 0 is assigned to a variable count.

```
set count to 0
```

```
// C, C++, Java implementation
int count = 0;

// JavaScript implementation
let count = 0;

// Python implementation
count = 0;
```

Suppose we need to determine the average ages of students in a class. We need to develop an algorithm for it. Based on the logic to determine the average value of an array, the pseudocode for that algorithm is given below.

```
Algorithm averageOfAnArray (arr, size)
This algorithm find out the average of an array
    pre    arr array containing integers
           size representing length of the array
    post   sum of the array elements printed
           average of the array elements printed
    return average of the array elements
1   set sum of array elements to 0
2   loop (not end of arr array)
    1   add array element to sum of array elements
3   end loop
4   set average value to sum of array elements / size
5   print sum of the array elements
5   print average of the array elements
6   return average value
end averageOfAnArray
```

```
// C++ implementation

/**
 * This algorithm find out the average of an array
 * @param arr array containing integers
 * @param size the length of the array
 * @returns average of the array elements
 * */
double averageOfAnArray(int arr[], int size) {
    int sumOfArrayElements = 0;
    for (int i=0; i<size; i++) {
        sumOfArrayElements += arr[i];
    }
    double averageValue = sumOfArrayElements / (double) size;
    printf("Sum of the array elements: %d\n", sumOfArrayElements);
    printf("Average value: %.2lf\n", averageValue);
    return averageValue;
}
```

```
// Python implementation

def average_of_an_array(arr: list, size: int) -> float:
    """
    This algorithm find out the average of an array
    :param arr: array containing integers
    :param size: the length of the array
    :returns: average of the array elements
    """
    sum_of_array_elements = 0
    for i in range(size):
        sum_of_array_elements += arr[i]
    average_value = sum_of_array_elements / size
    print("Sum of the array elements: %d" % sum_of_array_elements)
    print("Average value: %.2f" % average_value)
    return average_value
```
